# Employee-Management-System
Welcome to the Employee Management System (EMS) repository! This project is designed to streamline and simplify the process of managing employee data efficiently. Whether you're a small business owner or an HR professional, EMS empowers you to effortlessly add, edit, and delete employee information from a centralized database.

Key Features
User-Friendly Interface: Our intuitive web-based application ensures that adding and managing employee details is a breeze.

Database Integration: EMS seamlessly connects to a database, storing all employee information securely and making it accessible in real-time.

Employee Listing: The home page provides a comprehensive table that displays all employee data, making it easy to review and search for specific employees.

Edit and Delete: Each row in the employee table offers quick access to edit and delete functionality. Clicking on either option redirects you to a dedicated page for making changes or removing an employee's record.

Click "Add Employee" Button: On the dashboard of your system When a user clicks on it, they express their intent to add a new employee.

Redirect to Employee Information Form: After clicking "Add Employee," the user is redirected to another page, which is often a form. This form is used to collect the necessary information about the new employee. The form fields you mentioned, such as name, address, email, phone, and salary, are typically present on this page.

Fill Out Employee Information: The user fills out the required fields on the form. Each field should have a label to indicate what information is expected, and there may be optional fields or additional details that can be included as well.

Name: Typically includes fields for first name and last name.
Address: Allows the user to input the employee's address, which may include street address, city, state, and postal code.
Email: To collect the employee's email address.
Phone: To collect the employee's phone number.
Salary: To input the employee's salary information.
Validation: The form should include validation to ensure that the data entered is in the correct format. For example, email validation to check if it's a valid email address, and salary validation to ensure it's a numeric value within an acceptable range.

Submit the Form: Once all the required information is entered and any validation checks pass, the user can submit the form by clicking a "Submit" or "Save" button.

Adding an "Edit" functionality to allow users to update employee details is a common feature in many applications. Here's how this workflow typically works:

Submission Confirmation: After the user submits the employee information on the "Add Employee" page, they receive a confirmation message and are redirected to the main page or a list of employees. At this point, they can see the newly added employee in the list.

Edit Button: In the list of employees or on the employee details page, there is an "Edit" button associated with each employee record. When the user clicks the "Edit" button for a specific employee, they express their intent to edit that employee's information.

Redirect to Edit Page: Clicking the "Edit" button redirects the user to an "Edit Employee" page. This page is similar to the "Add Employee" page but pre-populated with the existing employee's information for editing.

Edit Employee Information: On the "Edit Employee" page, the user can modify the employee's details, including the name, address, email, phone, and salary. The form fields are pre-filled with the current data to make it easier for the user to make changes.

Validation: Similar to the "Add Employee" form, the "Edit Employee" form should also include validation to ensure that the edited data is in the correct format.
