Employee Management System
Welcome to the Employee Management System (EMS) repository! This project is designed to streamline and simplify the process of managing employee data efficiently. Whether you're a small business owner or an HR professional, EMS empowers you to effortlessly add, edit, and delete employee information from a centralized database.

Key Features
User-Friendly Interface: Our intuitive web-based application ensures that adding and managing employee details is a breeze.
Database Integration: EMS seamlessly connects to a database, storing all employee information securely and making it accessible in real-time.
Employee Listing: The home page provides a comprehensive table that displays all employee data, making it easy to review and search for specific employees.
